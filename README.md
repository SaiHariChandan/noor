Reimagine the way people travel traditionally and provide a solution that is more sustainable and has minimal effect on theÂ environment.

<h1>Problem Discription</h1>
- In the modern era where the number of vehicles in all sectors of transportation is booming globally, there is a spike in the carbon footprint.
